## How to start?
Once you have your electronics ready, you will need to do a few more things software wise. To start download this repository with the buttons above or clone it if you are experienced with git:

>git clone https://github.com/ivandoslic/Demeter-Rover.git

## Requirements
* Rover (fully completed)
* PC that will act as server
* Node.js so you can host the server
* Local Area Network in which devices will communicate
